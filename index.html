        <h3>the summary</h3>
        <p>
          Jack Worthing, the play’s protagonist, is a pillar of the community in
          Hertfordshire, where he is guardian to Cecily Cardew, the pretty,
          eighteen-year-old granddaughter of the late Thomas Cardew, who found
          and adopted Jack when he was a baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has
          responsibilities: he is a major landowner and justice of the peace,
          with tenants, farmers, and a number of servants and other employees
          all dependent on him. For years, he has also pretended to have an
          irresponsible black-sheep brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous
          life in pursuit of pleasure and is always getting into trouble of a
          sort that requires Jack to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact,
          Ernest is merely Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear
          for days at a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he
          himself is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is
          where he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very
          sort of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary
          brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax, the cousin of his best friend,
          Algernon Moncrieff. When the play opens, Algernon, who knows Jack as
          Ernest, has begun to suspect something, having found an inscription
          inside Jack’s cigarette case addressed to “Uncle Jack” from someone
          who refers to herself as “little Cecily.” Algernon suspects that Jack
          may be leading a double life, a practice he seems to regard as
          commonplace and indispensable to modern life. He calls a person who
          leads a double life a “Bunburyist,” after a nonexistent friend he
          pretends to have, a chronic invalid named Bunbury, to whose deathbed
          he is forever being summoned whenever he wants to get out of some
          tiresome social obligation.
